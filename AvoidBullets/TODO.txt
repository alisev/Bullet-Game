TO DO list: IMPORTANT THINGS
- Lives
	- Function that calls Gameover screen, when player dies
- Splash screen
	- See the sketch for visual reference
- Levels
	- Displays level number at the start of each level
	- During level highscore gets increased
- Other screens
	- Gamewin when player survives the final boss
	- Gameover when they run out of lives


IF I HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS:
- Highscore
	- Add a screen for displaying 10 best scores in descending order
	- Better formatted highscore:
		- BAD:	5
		- GOOD:	0000 0005
- Lives
	- Better visual aesthetic
- Splash screen
	- Implement full menu with
		- Play:				Starts the game
		- Level selection:	Selects and plays a particular level
		- Instructions:		Shows controls on separate screen
		- Quit:				Closes window
- Enemies
	- Are destroyed when shot
		- Shows explosion animation
- Sound
	- Royality free
	- Background music
		- Splash screen (calm)
		- Game music (intense)
		- Ideally game music would get more and more intense with each level
	- Sound effects
		- Bullets
		- Explosions
- Additional content
	- Extra lives (rare)
	- Boosts
		- Stronger attack
		- Higher speed
		- Lower speed
- Font
	- Use a better font

NOTES:
- In level_1.py:
	- Creating bulletLists by using command 'bulletLists = [pygame.sprites.Group()] * rows' caused the game to go as many times as fast as there were rows declared.
	- Correct way to call a function via dictionary (in order to avoid long if-elif-else lists) is dictionary = {i: function} and dictionary[i](arg)

LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Level 1:
	- Meteors should be destroyable by shooting
	- Upon being shot, meteors should play an animation of exploding
- Level 2:
	- If player collides with the ufos, player loses a life
	- Better bullet patterns?
- Level 3:
	- If player collides with the bug, player loses a life
	- Each row of bullets is loaded separately
	- The bug has to be destroyed to finsih the level
	- Upon destroying the bug, the bullets fly off on their own and then the level is finished
	- Bug has a floating animation
	- Bug's bullets are not attached to the bug itself (in bug.children)
	- Bug has destroying animation
- Point rewards for all levels:
	- For completing the level
	- For destroying enemies and in some cases - bullets
- Finally implement Gamewin and Gameover screens with an option to replay the game
- Check over the current function versions, which functions can be replaced by pygame built in features
	- Such as collission detection
