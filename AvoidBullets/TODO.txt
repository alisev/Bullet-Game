THINGS OF UPMOST IMPORTANCE RIGHT NOW:
- Create a new player sprite design (thinner ship)
	- Adjust hitbox accordingly


TO DO list: IMPORTANT THINGS
- Lives
	- Function that calls Gameover screen, when player dies
- Splash screen
	- See the sketch for visual reference
- Levels
	- Displays level number at the start of each level
	- During level highscore gets increased
- Other screens
	- Gamewin when player survives the final boss
	- Gameover when they run out of lives
- Character and Bullet class
	- Character
		- recalcPos
			- calls move(move_x, move_y) from Entity class - DONE
				- move_x, move_y - how much entity has moved
			- calls checkBound(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
				- for some reason changing checkbound values causes player sprite to disappear
				- ensure that the function is written correctly
				- add input arguments for the bounds, because the enemies could move only around certain area
				- x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max - bound's corner positions
				- x_pos, y_pos, width, height - alternate arguments
					- if isPlayer: can't leave bounds
					- else: return a bool variable to use
			- calls updateHitbox(x_pos, y_pos, width, height)
				- x_pos, y_pos - hitbox's position. Relative to Character's position
				- width, height - hitbox's width and height
			- add bound(tuple) and hitboxSize(tuple) properties
	- Bullet
		- recalcPos
			- calls move(move_x, move_y)
			- checkBound(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
				- checks if bullet is still inside screen
				- x_min = 0, x_max = constants.SCREEN_X, y_min = 0, y_max = constants.SCREEN_Y
				- if not: remove and return
			- updateHitbox(x_pos, y_pos, width, height)





IF I HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS:
- Highscore
	- Add a screen for displaying 10 best scores in descending order
	- Better formatted highscore:
		- BAD:	5
		- GOOD:	0000 0005
- Lives
	- Better visual aesthetic
- Splash screen
	- Implement full menu with
		- Play:				Starts the game
		- Level selection:	Selects and plays a particular level
		- Instructions:		Shows controls on separate screen
		- Quit:				Closes window
- Player
	- Player can shoot enemies
- Enemies
	- Are destroyed when shot
		- Shows explosion animation
- Sound
	- Royality free
	- Background music
		- Splash screen (calm)
		- Game music (intense)
		- Ideally game music would get more and more intense with each level
	- Sound effects
		- Bullets
		- Explosions
- Additional content
	- Extra lives (rare)
	- Boosts
		- Stronger attack
		- Higher speed
		- Lower speed
- Font
	- Use a better font
- Other screens
	- Move functions for all screens except game's to a new file
- Classes
	- Make some class methods private if possible.


NOTES:
- In level_1.py:
	- Creating bulletLists by using command 'bulletLists = [pygame.sprites.Group()] * rows' caused the game to go as many times as fast as there were rows declared.
	- Correct way to call a function via dictionary (in order to avoid long if-elif-else lists) is dictionary = {i: function} and dictionary[i](arg)

LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Level 1:
	- Meteors should be destroyable by shooting
	- Upon being shot, meteors should play an animation of exploding
- Level 2:
	- If player collides with the ufos, player loses a life
	- Better bullet patterns?
- Level 3:
	- If player collides with the bug, player loses a life
	- Each row of bullets is loaded separately
	- The bug has to be destroyed to finsih the level
	- Upon destroying the bug, the bullets fly off on their own and then the level is finished
	- Bug has a floating animation
	- Bug's bullets are not attached to the bug itself (in bug.children)
	- Bug has destroying animation
- Point rewards for all levels:
	- For completing the level
	- For destroying enemies and in some cases - bullets
- Finally implement Gamewin and Gameover screens with an option to replay the game
- Center bullets in relation to the ship
